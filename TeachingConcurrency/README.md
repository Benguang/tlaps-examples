# TeachingConcurrency

See [the paper: Teaching Concurrency](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/12/Teaching-Concurrency.pdf) for the problem.

See [What is the inductive invariant of the simple concurrent program?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46108331/1833118) for the TLA+ specification and TLAPS proof.

## TODO
- [x] Learn the spec and proof.
